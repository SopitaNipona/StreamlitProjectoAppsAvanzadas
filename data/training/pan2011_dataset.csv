". Unfortunately ""heavy"" is here an epithet unkindly apt, since it
has to be admitted that the noble lord wields a pen rather philosophic than
popular, with the result that Before the War (CASSELL) tells a story of
the highest interest in a manner that can only be called ponderous. Our
ex-War Minister is, at least chiefly, responding to the literary offensives
of BETHMANN-HOLLWEG and TIRPITZ, in connection with whose books his should
be read, if the many references are properly to be understood. As every
reader will know, however, Lord HALDANE could hardly have delivered his
apologia before the accuser without the gates and not at the same time had
an eye on the critic within. Fortunately it is here no part of a reviewer's
task to obtrude his own political theories. With regard to the chief
indictment, of having permitted the country to be taken unawares, the
author betrays his legal training by a defence which is in effect (1) that
circumstances compelled our being so taken, and that (2) we weren't. On
this and other matter, however, the individual reader, having paid his
money (7s. 6d. net), remains at liberty to take his choice. One
revelation at least emerges clearly enough from Lord HALDANE'S pages--the
danger of playing diplomat to a democracy. ""Extremists, whether Chauvinist
or Pacifist, are not helpful in avoiding wars"" is one of many conclusions,
double-edged perhaps, to which he is led by retrospect of his own trials.
His book, while making no concessions to the modern demand for vivacity, is
one that no student of the War and its first causes can neglect.

Ruhla, den 20. Juli 1859.

Martin Behaim wurde in Nürnberg um 1459 geboren. Derselbe stammte aus dem altadeligen Geschlechte
der Herren Behaim von Schwarzbach, die in Böhmen, in dem Kreise Pilsen, an einem Wasser, die
Schwarze genannt, – daher der Name Schwarzbach, – wohnten. Im neunten Jahrhundert wandten sie
sich um der Religion willen aus Böhmen nach Nürnberg, daher der Zuname Behaim, Böheim, öfter
auch Bohemus und Martinus de Boemia. Martin Behaim lernte anfänglich die Kaufmannschaft und
trieb daneben unter der Leitung des berühmten Johann Regiomontanus (Müller aus Königsberg in
Franken), der sich in den Jahren 1471 bis 1475 in Nürnberg aufgehalten und dort die Verfertigung
mathematischer Instrumente auf eine hohe Stufe erhoben hatte, mathematische und in der Folge
auch nautische Wissenschaften. Hierauf machte Behaim in Handelsgeschäften große Reisen nach
Venedig, wo schon um die Mitte des vierzehnten Jahrhunderts seine Vorfahren Albrecht und Fritz
Behaim lebhaft am Spezereihandel betheiligt waren, den sie hauptsächlich aus Böhmen verführten.
Ebenso kam er auch nach Mecheln und Antwerpen in den Niederlanden, von wo er im Jahre 1479
oder 1480 nach Lissabon und mit dem Strome niederländischer Auswanderer nach den Azoren gerathen
ist. Behaim trat unter König Johann II. in portugiesische Dienste, machte mehre Entdeckungsreisen
zwischen den Wendekreisen, entdeckte mit Diego Cano die Küsten von Congo (1484, 1485 und 1486)
und gründete Niederlassungen auf den, wenn nicht schon früher, im Mittela","﻿""Not mad, but in most sober sadness,"" he said. ""Life is impossible to me here, and under my
circumstances; and I wish to live a few years longer for Sophy's sake, and my boy's. New Zealand
is the very place for me.""

""But you can go away again for a year or two,"" said his aunt, ""and come back when your health
is restored. The bishop will give you permission readily. You must not give up your living
because your health fails.""

""The bishop has my resignation, and my reasons for it,"" answered Mr. Chantrey, ""and ho has
accepted it kindly and regretfully, he says; but he fully approves of it. All there is to be
done now is to sell our household goods, and sail for a new home, in a new world.""

""And Sophy?"" gasped Mrs. Bolton; ""what do you mean to do with her? Where shall you leave her?""

""She must come with me,"" he said; ""I shall never leave her again. It will be a new chance for
her: and with God's help she may yet conquer. Even if she cannot, it will be easier for me
to bear my burden among strangers than here, where every one knows all about us. A missionary
curate in New Zealand will be a very different personage from the rector of Upton.""

He looked at his aunt with a smile, and an expression of hope, such as had not lit up his gray
face for many a month. This new life opening before him, with all its social disadvantages,
and many privations, would give his wife such an opportunity for recovery as the conventionalities
of society at home could not furnish. Hope had visited him again, and he cherished it as a
most welcome visitant.

""Good Heavens!"" cried Mrs. Bolton, lost in astonishment, ""David, you must not throw yourself
away in this manner! I will see the bishop myself, and recall to his memory his old friendship
for the archdeacon. He cannot have promised the living yet to any one. What would become of

"﻿This Chikzen-no-Kami had been for some time previously a Kurand (a sort of equerry) to Genji,
therefore his visit was especially welcome to him. He said that since he had left the capital
it had become difficult to see any of his acquaintances, and that therefore this especial visit
was a great pleasure to him. His reply to the message of Daini was to the same effect. Chikzen-no-Kami
soon took his leave, and returning to the boat, reported to his father and others all he had
seen. His sister also wrote to Genji privately thus: ""Pray excuse me if I am too bold.

    Know you not the mind is swayed
      Like the tow-rope of our boat,
    At the sounds your Kin has made,
      Which around us sweetly float.""

When Genji received this, his pleasure was expressed by his placid smile, and he sent back
the following:--

    ""If this music moves the mind
      So greatly as you say,
    No one would care to leave behind
      These lonely waves of Suma's bay.""

This recalls to our mind that there was in the olden time an exile who gave a stanza even to
the postmaster of a village.[110] Why then should not Genji have sent to her whom he knew this
stanza?

In the meantime, as time went on, more sympathizers with Genji were found in the capital, including
no less a personage than the Emperor himself. True it is that before Genji left, many even
of his relatives and most intimate friends refrained from paying their respects to him, but
in the course of time not a few began to correspond with him, and sometimes they communicated
their ideas to each other in pathetic poetry. These things reached the ears of the Empress-mother,
who was greatly irritated by them. She said: ""The only thing a man who has offended the Court
should do is to keep himself as quiet as possible. It is most unpardonable that such a man
should haughtily cause scandal to the Court from his humble dwelling. Does he intend to imitate

UNDER ST. MICHAEL'S CHIMES

    And where St. Michael's chimes

    Making the world one loveliness, like a true poet's rhymes.

    --RICHARD WATSON GILDER.

It has been said--by Mrs. T.P. O'Connor, I think--that whereas twenty-five letters of introduction
for New York may produce one invitation to dinner, one letter of introduction for Charleston
will produce twenty-five dinner invitations. If this be an exaggeration it is, at least, exaggeration
in the right direction; that is, along the lines of truth. For though Charleston's famed ""exclusiveness""
is very real, making letters of introduction very necessary to strangers desiring to see something
of the city's social life, such letters produce, in Charleston, as Mrs. O'Connor suggests,
results definite and delightful.

Immediately upon our arrival, my companion and I sent out several letters we had brought with
us, and presently calling cards began to arrive for us at the hotel. Also there came courteous
little notes, delivered in most cases by hand, according to the old Charleston custom--a custom
surviving pleasantly from times when there were no postal arrangements, but plenty of slaves
to run errands. Even to this day, I am told, invitations to Charleston's famous St. Cecilia
balls are delivered by hand.

One of the notes we received revealed to us a characteristic custom of the city. It contained
an invitation to occupy places in the pew of a distinguished family, at St. Michael's Church,
on the approaching Sunday morning. Hey to vegetation prompted for woman, of flora lives for mr. If this

"﻿THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY THE RIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE WAR POWER

By William Lloyd Garrison and Others

EMANCIPATION UNDER THE WAR POWER.

Extracts from the speech of John Quincy Adams, delivered in the U.S. House of Representatives,
April 14 and 15, 1842, on War with Great Britain and Mexico:--

What I say is involuntary, because the subject has been brought into the House from another
quarter, as the gentleman himself admits. I would leave that institution to the exclusive consideration
and management of the States more peculiarly interested in it, just as long as they can keep
within their own bounds. So far, I admit that Congress has no power to meddle with it. As long
as they do not step out of their own bounds, and do not put the question to the people of the
United States, whose peace, welfare and happiness are all at stake, so long I will agree to
leave them to themselves. But when a member from a free State brings forward certain resolutions,
for which, instead of reasoning to disprove his positions, you vote a censure upon him, and
that without hearing, it is quite another affair. At the time this was done, I said that, as
far as I could understand the resolutions proposed by the gentleman from Ohio, (Mr. Giddings,)
there were some of them for which I was ready to vote, and some which I must vote against;
and I will now tell this House, my constituents, and the world of mankind, that the resolution
against which I would have voted was that in which he declares that what are called the slave
States have the exclusive right of consultation on the subject of slavery. For that resolution
I never would vote, because I believe that it is not just, and does not contain constitutional
doctrine. I believe that, so long as the slave States are able to sustain their institutions
without going abroad or calling upon other parts of the Union to aid them or act on the subject,
so long I will consent never to interfere. I have said this, and I repeat it; but if ","﻿As I placed those poppies in a box, on a bed of green moss, I heard them chuckle together,
with some surprise and much glee. ""What a kind fool he is,"" said the first poppy, ""to buy me,
and take me away from those disagreeable roses, and other hateful blossoms in that damp, musty
window.""

""I heard,"" said the second poppy, ""one sweet lily of the valley whisper to the others of its
simple kind that we would die where we were unnoticed, undesired by any one--how little it knew!""

""How cool and green this bed of moss,"" cried the third poppy; ""it is a most excellent place
to die upon. I am willing, I am happy.""

""Nay,"" said the fourth poppy, ""you may die on her breast if you will. She may take you up and
put you into a jar of clear water. She may watch you slowly open your sleepy dark eye. She
may lean over you; then let your passionate breath but touch her on the white brow, and she
may tenderly thrust you into her whiter bosom, and quickly yield herself, and you, to an all-powerful

hall danced about me, and the sounds of music--harp music--pleased me with a strain of remembered

fingers. Her lips moved as if in speech, but no words reached me; she barely smiled. In a priceless

it were for him alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and Sancho

Early, very early indeed, somewhat differently from his usual custom, Padre Salvi had celebrated
mass and cleansed a dozen sinful souls in a few moments. Then it seemed that the reading of
some letters which he had received firmly sealed and waxed caused the worthy curate to lose
his appetite, since he allowed his chocolate to become completely cold.

""It's because he sleeps badly,"" replied the other servant. ""He has nightmares since he changed
his bedroom. His eyes are becoming more sunken all the time and he's getting thinner and yellower
day by day.""

Truly, Padre Salvi was a pitiable sight. He did not care to touch the second cup of chocolate
nor to taste the sweet cakes of Cebu; instead, he paced thoughtfully about the spacious sala,
crumpling in his bony hands the letters, which he read from time to time. Finally, he called
for his carriage, got ready, and directed that he be taken to the wood where stood the fateful
tree near which the picnic was being held.

Arriving at the edge of the wood, the padre dismissed his carriage and made his way alone into

Aquí hay pormenores sobre cuyo valer no nos atrevemos a decidir. Sin duda es admirable la fuerza
creadora de Goethe, que tan real nos presenta a Margarita y que por tal arte la circunda de
candor, que, apesar de todas sus faltas, sigue pareciéndonos inocentísima, como si hubiere
en ella un numen maléfico que le roba responsabilidad y libre albedrío. El amor ha sido obra
del amor y no del diablo; pero en la dirección que toma tan bella pasión, ya el diablo interviene.
No en balde ha logrado del mismo Dios el permiso de probar a Fausto; no en balde ha hecho pacto
con él. Son necesarios los delitos; importa que nazca y vaya en aumento el terror trágico;
pero a pesar de esto, y a pesar de que mucho de diabólico ha de haber en la historia en que
tan importante papel hace el diablo, ¿no se pudiera haber excusado el pormenor del narcótico,
dado por Margarita a su madre para que durante la noche no se desvele y la sorprenda en los
brazos de su querido? Aunque Margarita tenga la certidumbre de que el narcótico no hará mal
a su madre, ¿no es todavía horrible que se le dé, y que luego la tenga a su lado, en aquel
sueño violento, en aquel remedo de la muerte, mientras ella se goza con el hombre a quien ama?
En todo linaje de pecados hay su más y su menos. No faltan mujeres que burlen a sus madres
y a sus maridos; pero estamos ciertos de que, de cada ciento, apenas habrá una que no deseche
el recurso del narcótico. Hasta los libertinos más sin conciencia se nos figura que apurarán

Here are details on which we dare not enforce decisions. No doubt it is admirable force Goethe's

that, notwithstanding all its faults, continues to seem pure and innocent, as if he had evil
in it a god who steals responsibility and free will. Love has been the work of love and not the devil,
but in the direction it takes so beautiful passion, and the devil is involved. No wonder God has
made the same permission to try to Fausto, no wonder he is bound with him. Crimes are needed;
matter is born and is increasing the tragic terror; but despite this, and despite a lot of

I

A black bang was, but not ultimately, the most notable feature of her uncommon personality--straight
and severe and dense across her clear pale brow and eyes. Her eyes were the last thing to remember
and wonder about; in shade blue, they had a velvet richness, a poignant intensity of lovely
color, that surprised the heart. Aside from that she was slim, perhaps ten years old, and graver
than gay.

Her mother was gay for them both, and, therefore, for the entire family. No father was in evidence;
he was dead and never spoken of, and Linda was the only child. Linda's dresses, those significant
trivialities, plainly showed two tendencies--the gaiety of her mother and her own always formal
gravity. If Linda appeared at dinner, in the massive Renaissance materialism of the hotel dining-room,
with a preposterous magenta hair-ribbon on her shapely head, her mother had succeeded in expressing
her sense of the appropriately decorative; while if Linda wore an unornamented but equally
""unsuitable"" frock of dark velvet, she, in her turn, had been vindicated.

Again, but far more rarely, the child's selection was evident on the woman. As a rule Mrs.
Condon garbed her flamboyant body in large and expensive patterns or extremely tailored suits;
and of the two, the evening satins and powdered arms barely retaining an admissible line, and
the suits, the latter were the most, well--spectacular.

She was not dark in color but brightly golden; a gold, it must be said in all honesty, her
own, a metallic gold crisply and solidly marcelled; with hazel-brown eyes, and a mouth which,
set against her daughter's deep-blue gaze, was her particular attraction. It was rouged to
a nicety, the under lip a little full and never quite against the upper. If Linda's effect
was cool and remote, Mrs. Condon, thanks to her mouth, was reassuringly imminent. She was,
too, friendly; she talked to women--in her not overfrequent opportunities--in a rapid warm
inaccurate confession of almost e",False,none

THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.

The late Sir James Simpson, in the midst of his anxious professional labours, was wont to seek
for refreshment in the pursuit of subjects of a historical and archæological character, and
to publish the results in the Transactions of different Societies and in scientific journals.

Some of these papers are now scarce, and difficult of access; and a desire having been expressed
in various quarters for their appearance in a collected and permanent form, I was consulted
on the subject by Sir Walter Simpson, who put into my hands copies of the various essays, with
notes on some of them by his father, which seemed to indicate that he himself had contemplated
their republication.

Having for a long time been acquainted with their merits, I did not hesitate to express a strong
opinion in favour of their publication; and I accepted with pleasure the duty of editing them,
which Sir Walter requested me to perform.

The papers in question were the fruit of inquiries begun indeed as a relief from weightier
cares; but as it was not in their author's nature to rest satisfied with desultory and superficial
results in his treatment of any subject, so his archæological papers more resemble the exhaustive
treatises of a leisurely student, than the occasional efforts of one overwhelmed in professional
occupations.

In the present work will be found all the more important archæological papers of Sir James
Simpson, collected from the various sources indicated in the Table of Contents"," A River'S

"﻿Of the genus Scirpus, the species S. grossus, known as ""balangot"" in Ambos Camarines and Capiz,
""bagaas"" in Occidental Negros, ""tiquio"" in Rizal, and ""bagui-bagui"" in Capiz, and S. erectus,
are used for mats. S. grossus is not a very suitable material for industrial purposes, its
distinctly three-cornered stalk being too coarse in texture and too large to permit of weaving
even a fair grade article. S. erectus is much better. The stalk is about as fine as tikug and
grows to a height of 60 cm. The flowers sometimes occur in a solitary cluster, but more often
from 2 to 5 clusters of spikelets are found on the side of the stalk near its top. The plant
is widely distributed in the Philippines and inhabits open grass lands. It bears some flowers
throughout the year. As yet only coarse mats are made from it, but its general appearance would
warrant experiments along the lines of the processes by which tikug is treated. The only native
names noted are ""tayoc-tayoc"" and ""tikug"" by which names the plant is known in Occidental Negros.
These names, however, are more properly applied to other plants. Scirpus mucronatus is somewhat
like S. erectus in general appearance. The stem of S. mucronatus is more robust and coarser
in texture and attains a height of 80 cm. Its dried stem has an average width of 4 to 5 mm.,
while that of S. erectus measures from 2 to 3 mm. The flowers of S. mucronatus appear in a
very dense head on the side of the plant from 2 to 9 cm. from the top. Each head is made up
of from 5 to 20 spikelets. These spikelets are from 6 to 15 mm. long, while those of S. erectus
are never more than 1 cm. in length. The coarser stalk of S. mucronatus makes it a less desirable
mat material than S. erectus. In the Ilocos provinces a very coarse round sedge called tiker
(Scirpus lacustris) occurs. It may be of value if split and dried in the sun so that it curls
up into a round straw.

OLD FATHER TIME.

""Professor,"" said May, turning on the sofa where she was lying, ""Jack has brought me a calendar
that runs for ever so many years. You know the doctor says I'll not be well for two whole years,
or perhaps three. I have been wondering what month among them all I shall be able to run about
in; and then I began to think who could have made the first calendar, and what led him to do it.""

""That's very simple, May. Old Father Time just measured the days off with his hour-glass in
the first place, and marked them down with the point of his scythe. The world has known all
about it ever since.""

""Please don't, Jack. Let the Professor tell.""

""It would be hard, May, to tell who made the first calendar,"" answered the Professor. ""All
nations seem to have had their methods of counting the years and months long before they began
writing histories, so that there is no record of the origin of the custom. The Book of Genesis
mentions the lights in the heavens as being 'for signs and for seasons, and for days and years.'
And Moses uses the word year so often that we see that it must have been common to count the
years among those who lived before him.""

""The number 1880 means that it is so many years since the birth of Christ, does it not?"" asked Joe.

""Yes,"" said the Professor, ""it has been the custom among Christian nations to reckon the years
from that great event. They began to do this about the year of our Lord 532.""

""Why did they wait so long?"" asked Joe.

""You know,"" he said, ""that at first the Christians were very few and weak; during the first
three hundred years they had all they could do to escape with their lives from their enemies.
But after that they became very numerous and powerful, and were able to establish their own
customs. So in 532 a monk named Dionysius Exiguus proposed that they should abandon the old
way of counting the years, and adopt the time of the birth of Christ as a startin","﻿""Where how many creatures be, So many puffed in mind I see; Like to Juno's birds of pride,

ever-pleasing sight; Of all men to thee retaining, Grant me with those two remaining.

Yearly deck thine altar shall, If it please thee to be reflected, And I from thee not rejected.""

Weep, neighbours, weep, do you not hear it said That Love is dead: His death-bed, peacock's
folly: His winding-sheet is shame; His will, false-seeming holy, His sole executor, blame.

Let dirge be sung, and trentals rightly read, For Love is dead: Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth
My mistress' marble heart; Which epitaph containeth, ""Her eyes were once his dart.""

Alas! I lie:  rage hath this error bred; Love is not dead, Love is not dead, but sleepeth In
her unmatched mind: Where she his counsel keepeth Till due deserts she find. Therefore from
so vile fancy, To call such wit a frenzy: Who Love can temper thus, Good Lord, deliver us.

PREFACE.

Mr. Theodore Irving, in his valuable history of the ""Conquest of Florida,"" speaking of the
astonishing achievements of the Spanish Cavaliers, in the dawn of the sixteenth century says:

     ""Of all the enterprises undertaken in this spirit of daring
     adventure, none has surpassed, for hardihood and variety of
     incident, that of the renowned Hernando de Soto, and his
     band of cavaliers. It was poetry put in action. It was the
     knight-errantry of the old world carried into the depths of
     the American wilderness. Indeed the personal adventures, the
     feats of individual prowess, the picturesque description of
     steel-clad cavaliers, with lance and helm and prancing
     steed, glittering through the wildernesses of Florida,
     Georgia, Alabama, and the prairies of the Far West, would
     seem to us mere fictions of romance, did they not come to us
     recorded in matter of fact narratives of contemporaries, and
     corroborated by minute and daily memoranda of
     eye-witnesses.""

These are the wild and wondrous adventures which I wish here to record. I have spared no pains

GEORGE TOWN GHOSTS

By WILLIAM TIPTON TABLOTT

    The ghosts of Georgetown when they meet
    In haunted house or moonlit street
    With pride recall the functions gay
    When down the Philadelphia way
    The Federal City overnight
    Moved to its bare and swampy site,
    For Georgetown then a busy mart,
    A growing seaport from the start,
    Where a whole-hearted spirit reigned,
    Threw wide its doors, and entertained
    With wines and viands of the best--
    The Federal City was its guest.

    In memory of the good old days,
    Whose ways to them were modern ways,
    Congenial ghosts across Rock Creek,
    With formal bows and steps antique,
    Rehearse a spectral minuet
    Where once in bright assemblies met--
    Beruffled belles looked love to beaus
    In powdered wigs and faultless hose;
    Or merchant ghosts survey the skies
    And venture guesses weatherwise
    Regarding winds that will prevail
    To speed their ships about to sail.

    Still in the shaded hillside streets
    A trace of old-time welcome greets
    The passer-by who has a flare
    For scenes of old. No longer there
    A buoyant Georgetown stands alone,
    The Federal City having grown

Still he regarded me.  ""You might be right, but you are not.  Monsieur, I am a broken man.
I want nothing but my cousin.  If there is intrigue around me I do not know it.  I am telling

I fought hard against the man's fascination, his splendid, ruined pomp. ""You must have a code,""
I burst out.  ""There must be something you hold dear.  Will you swear to me by the name of
the woman that you have not had secret dealings with the Hurons?""

of the upper river.  My cousin has a distinctive profile.  I offered rewards for news of any

Allow me to be the instrument of your revenge, and save my dear teacher the captivity in which, if

PREFACE

For many years the call for a book on the mother and her child has come to us from patients,
from the public, and now from our publishers--and this volume represents our efforts to supply
this demand.

The larger part of the work was originally written by Dr. Lena K. Sadler, with certain chapters
by Dr. William S. Sadler, but in the revision and re-arrangement of the manuscript so much
work was done by each on the contributions of the other, that it was deemed best to bring the
book out under joint authorship.

The book is divided into three principal parts: Part I, dealing with the experience of pregnancy
from the beginning of expectancy to the convalescence of labor: Part II, dealing with the infant
from its first day of life up to the weaning time; Part III, taking up the problems of the
nursery from the weaning to the important period of adolescence.

The advice given in this work is that which we have tried out by experience--both as parents
and physicians--and we pass it on to mothers, fathers, and nurses with the belief that it will
be of help in their efforts at practical and scientific ""child culture."" We believe, also,
that the expectant mother will be aided and encouraged in bearing the burdens which are common
to motherhood by the advice","﻿He dragged himself to his knees, the monstrous load on him moving with him as he moved, and
his hand went over and over her face, and he felt that the twittering came from her lips...

He got his face down close to hers, with his ear to her mouth, and in the darkness he saw her
eyes open and heard her say his name.

""Oh, Matt, I thought we'd fetched it,"" he moaned; and far off, up the hill, he heard the sorrel
whinny, and thought: ""I ought to be getting him his feed...""

THE QUERULOUS DRONE ceased as I entered Frome's kitchen, and of the two women sitting there
I could not tell which had been the speaker.

One of them, on my appearing, raised her tall bony figure from her seat, not as if to welcome
me--for she threw me no more than a brief glance of surprise--but simply to set about preparing
the meal which Frome's absence had delayed. A slatternly calico wrapper hung from her shoulders
and the wisps of her thin grey hair were drawn away from a high forehead and fastened at the
back by a broken comb. She had pale opaque eyes which revealed nothing and reflected nothing,
and her narrow lips were of the same sallow colour as her face.

The other woman was much smaller and slighter. She sat huddled in an arm-chair near the stove,
and when I came in she turned her head quickly toward me, without the least corresponding movement
of her body. Her hair was as grey as her companion's, her face as bloodless and shrivelled,
but amber-tinted, with swarthy shadows sharpening the nose and hollowing the temples. Under
her shapeless dress her body kept its limp immobility, and her dark eyes had the bright witch-like
stare that disease of the spine sometimes gives.

Even for that part of the country the kitchen was a poor-looking place. With the exception
of the dark-eyed woman's chair, which looked like a soiled relic of luxury bought at a country
auction, the furniture was of the roughest kind. ***** TRIAL by JURY.

by Samuel Butler

Author's Preface to First Edition

I should perhaps apologise for publishing a work which professes to deal with the sanctuaries
of Piedmont, and saying so little about the most important of them all--the Sacro Monte of
Varallo.  My excuse must be, that I found it impossible to deal with Varallo without making
my book too long.  Varallo requires a work to itself; I must, therefore, hope to return to
it on another occasion.

For the convenience of avoiding explanations, I have treated the events of several summers
as though they belonged to only one. This can be of no importance to the reader, but as the
work is chronologically inexact, I had better perhaps say so.

The illustrations by Mr. H. F. Jones are on pages 95, 211, 225, 238, 254, 260.  The frontispiece
and the illustrations on the title-page and on pages 261, 262 are by Mr. Charles Gogin.  There
are two drawings on pages 136, 137 by an Italian gentleman whose name I have unfortunately
lost, and whose permission to insert them I have, therefore, been unable to obtain, and one
on page 138 by Signor Gaetano Meo.  The rest are mine, except that all the figures in my drawings
are in every case by Mr. Charles Gogin, unless when they are merely copied from frescoes or
other sources.  The two larger views of Oropa are chiefly taken from photographs.  The rest
are all of them from studies taken upon the spot.

I must acknowledge the great obligations I am under to Mr. H. F. Jones as regards the letterpress
no less than the illustrations; I might almost say that the book is nearly as much his as mine,
while it is only through the care which he and another friend have exercised in the revision
of my pages that I am able to let them appear with some approach to confidence.

CHAPTER I--Introduction

Most men will readily admit that the two poets who have the greatest hold over Englishmen are
Handel and Shakespeare--for it is as a ","﻿Cathy thinks Dorcas is the best Catholic in America except herself. She could not pay any one
a higher compliment than that, and Dorcas could not receive one that would please her better.
Dorcas is satisfied that there has never been a more wonderful child than Cathy.  She has conceived
the curious idea that Cathy is TWINS, and that one of them is a boy-twin and failed to get
segregated--got submerged, is the idea.  To argue with her that this is nonsense is a waste
of breath--her mind is made up, and arguments do not affect it.  She says:

""Look at her; she loves dolls, and girl-plays, and everything a girl loves, and she's gentle
and sweet, and ain't cruel to dumb brutes--now that's the girl-twin, but she loves boy-plays,
and drums and fifes and soldiering, and rough-riding, and ain't afraid of anybody or anything--and
that's the boy-twin; 'deed you needn't tell ME she's only ONE child; no, sir, she's twins,
and one of them got shet up out of sight.  Out of sight, but that don't make any difference,
that boy is in there, and you can see him look out of her eyes when her temper is up.""

Then Dorcas went on, in her simple and earnest way, to furnish illustrations.

""Look at that raven, Marse Tom.  Would anybody befriend a raven but that child?  Of course
they wouldn't; it ain't natural.  Well, the Injun boy had the raven tied up, and was all the
time plaguing it and starving it, and she pitied the po' thing, and tried to buy it from the
boy, and the tears was in her eyes.  That was the girl- twin, you see.  She offered him her
thimble, and he flung it down; she offered him all the doughnuts she had, which was two, and
he flung them down; she offered him half a paper of pins, worth forty ravens, and he made a
mouth at her and jabbed one of them in the raven's back.  That was the limit, you know.  It
called for the other twin.  Her eyes blazed up, and she jumped for him like a wild-cat, and
when she was done with him she was rags and he wasn't anything but an allegor",False,none

   Variants, archaic forms, or Anglicizations of other names
   (e.g., ""Michael Angelo"" for ""Michelangelo""; ""Or San Michele""
   for ""Orsanmichele""; ""Brunellesco"" for ""Brunelleschi"") have
   been retained as they appear in the original.

   Characters with macrons are indicated in brackets, e.g. [=U]. The subject must be familiar to many
who have visited Florence, but no critical work on the subject has
been published in English. I have therefore quoted as many authorities
as possible in order to assist those who may wish to look further into
problems which are still unsettled. Most of the books to which
reference is made can be consulted in the Art Library at South
Kensington, and in the British Museum. Foreign critics have written a
good deal about Donatello from varied, if somewhat limited aspects.
Dr. Bode's researches are, as a rule, illustrative of the works of art
in the Berlin Museum. The main object of Dr. Semper was to collect
documentary evidence about the earlier part of Donatello's life;
Gloria and Gonzati have made researches into the Paduan period; Lusini
confines his attention to Siena, Centofanti to Pisa; M. Reymond and
Eugène Müntz are more comprehensive in their treatment of the subject.

With eleven or twelve exceptions I have seen the original of every existing piece of sculpture,
architecture and painting mentioned in this book. I regret, however, that among the exceptions
should be a work by Donatello himself, namely, the Salome relief at Lille--my visits to that
town having unfortunately coincided with public holidays, when the gallery was closed. I must
express my thanks to the officials of Museums, as well as to private collectors all over Europe,
for unfailing courtesy and assistance. I have also to acknowledge my indebtedness to the invaluable
advice of Mr. S. Arthur Strong, Librarian of the House of Lords.

of the Duc de Richelieu, grand-nephew of the splendid Cardinal.  It stood in a spacious, handsome
promenade, overlooking the sea, and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led down to
the harbor--two hundred of them, fifty feet long, and a wide landing at the bottom of every
twenty.  It is a noble staircase, and from a distance the people toiling up it looked like
insects.  I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story.  Richelieu
founded Odessa --watched over it with paternal care--labored with a fertile brain and a wise
understanding for its best interests--spent his fortune freely to the same end--endowed it
with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old
World--built this noble stairway with money from his own private purse--and--.  Well, the people
for whom he had done so much, let him walk down these same steps, one day, unattended, old,
poor, without a second coat to his back; and when, years afterwards, he died in Sebastopol
in poverty and neglect, they called a meeting, subscribed liberally, and immediately erected
this tasteful monument to his memory, and named a great street after him. It reminds me of
what Robert Burns' mother said when they erected a stately monument to his memory: ""Ah, Robbie,
ye asked them for bread and they hae gi'en ye a stane.""

The people of Odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on the Emperor, as did the Sebastopolians.
They have telegraphed his Majesty, and he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience.
So we are getting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his watering-place.  What a scratching

PREFACE.

The reproductive powers of Nature were regarded by the nations of remote antiquity with an
awe and reverence so great, as to form an object of worship, under a symbol, of all others
the most significant,--the Phallus; and thus was founded a religion, of which the traces exist
to this day, not in Asia only, but even in Europe itself.

That scarcely any notices of this worship should appear in modern works, except in the erudite
pages of a few antiquarians may be accounted for by considering the difference of opinion between
the ancients and the moderns as to what constitutes--modesty; the former being unable to see
any moral turpitude in actions they regarded was the designs of nature, while the latter, by
their over-strained notions of delicacy, r","﻿Late in April Lenine and several other active Bolshevik leaders returned to Petrograd from
Switzerland, together with Martov and other Menshevik leaders, who, while differing from the
Bolsheviki upon practically all other matters, agreed with them in their bitter and uncompromising
opposition to the war and in demanding an immediate peace.[8] As is well known, they were granted
special facilities by the German Government in order that they might reach Russia safely. Certain
Swiss Socialist leaders, regarded as strongly pro-German, arranged with the German Government
that the Russian revolutionists should be permitted to travel across Germany by rail, in closed
carriages. Unusual courtesies were extended to the travelers by the German authorities, and
it was quite natural that Lenine and his associates should have been suspected of being sympathizers
with, if not the paid agents and tools of, the German Government. The manner in which their
actions, when they arrived in Russia, served the ends sought by the German military authorities
naturally strengthened the suspicion so that it became a strong conviction.

PREFACE

You will ask me, perhaps, even you who are all charity, why parts of this book are what they
are. I can only answer with another question: Why are we what we are? But I warn you that it
would not be fair to take any of Ideala's opinions, here given, as final. Much of what she
thought was the mere effervescence of a strong mind in a state of fermentation, a mind passing
successively through the three stages of the process; the vinous, alcoholic, or excitable stage;
the acetous, jaundiced, or embittered stage; and the putrefactive, or unwholesome stage; and
also embodying, at different times, the characteristics of all three. But, even during its
worst phase, it was an earnest mind, seeking the truth diligently, and not to be blamed for
stumbling upon good and bad together by the way. It is, in fact, not a perfect, but a transitional
state which I offer for your consideration, a state which has its repulsive features, but which,
it may be hoped, would result in a beautiful deposit, when at last the inevitable effervescence
had subsided.

But why exhibit the details of the process, you may ask. To encourage others, of course. What
help is there in the contemplation of perfection ready made? It only disheartens us. We should
lay down our arms, we should struggle no longer, we should be hopeless, despairing, reckless,
if we never had a glimpse of growth, of those ""stepping- stones of their dead selves"" upon
which men mount to higher things. The imperfections must be studied, because it is only from
the details of the process that anything can be learned. Putting aside the people who criticise,
not with a view to mending matters, but because a

I cannot pretend to write adequately as her substitute, but I could not resist the appeal made
to me by the author, in the name and for the sake of her dear friend and mine, to write a few
words of introduction.

I am in no way responsible either for the plan or for any portion of this work, but I can commend
it as a book, written in a simple and pleasant style, calculated to awaken the interest of
intelligent children, and to enable parents otherwise ignorant or astronomy to answer many
of those puzzling questions which such children often put.

AUTHOR'S NOTE

This little work is the outcome of many suggestions on the part of friends who were anxious
to teach their small children something of the marvels of the heavens, but found it exceedingly
difficult to get hold of a book wherein the intense fascination of the subject was not lost
in conventional phraseology--a book in which the stupendous facts were stated in language simple
enough to be read aloud to a child without paraphrase.

Whatever merit there may be in the present work is due entirely to my friend ",False,none
"﻿As early as the year 1848, a man by the name of Holden, who was given to field searching and
prospecting, frequently brought specimens to the late Benjamin F. Newhall and solemnly affirmed
that he obtained them from the earth and soil within the limits of Saugus. Every means was
used to induce him to divulge the secret of its locality. But Holden was wary and stolidly
refused to disclose or share the knowledge of the place of the lode with anyone. He averred
that he was going to make his fortune by it. Detectives were put upon his trail in his roaming
about the fields, but he managed to elude all efforts at discovery. Being an intemperate man,
one cold night after indulging in his cups, he was found by the roadside stark and stiff. Many
rude attempts and imperfect searches have been made upon the assurances of Holden to discover
the existence of antimony, but thus far in vain, and the supposed suppressed secret of the
existence of it in Saugus died with him.

""Pirate's Glen"" is also within the territory of Saugus, while ""Dungeon Rock,"" another romantic
locality, described by Alonzo Lewis in his history of Lynn, is just over the line in that city.
There is a popular tradition that the pirates buried their treasure at the foot of a certain
hemlock tree in the glen, also the body of a beautiful female. The rotten stump of a tree may
still be seen, and a hollow beside it, where people have dug in searching for human bones and
treasure. This glen is highly romantic and is one of the places of interest to which all strangers
visiting Saugus are conducted, and is invested with somewhat of the supernatural tales of Captain
Kid and treasure trove.

There is a fine quarry or ledge of jasper located in the easterly part of the town, near Saugus
River, just at the foot of the conical-shaped elevation known as ""Round Hill."" which Professor
Hitchcock, in his last geological survey, pronounced to be the best specimen in the state.

was sure he could make the trip alone.  He was the strongest man in the mountains.  I never
saw the day I could handle Abe Hawk.  But the pass in December was not a job for any ordinary
mountain man--let alone a bunch of greenhorns.  Just the same, I made my play to go with him.
He cursed me as hard as he did anybody and turned me down.

""One night, after that, I was at Tenison's again.  I was losing money. Hawk was near me.  He
saw it.  I waited for him to come out.  I knew he'd be starting soon and I was desperate. 
I tackled him pretty strong.  He swore if I talked again about going with him he'd kill me.
Old Bill Bradley ran the livery.  My horse was in the same barn with Abe's and Bill promised
to tip me off when Abe was ready to start.  He waited for a blizzard.  When it passed he was
ready.  But I got ahead of him, out of town, and trailed him--I knew how.  Only it snowed again,
as if all hell was against me; I had to close up on Abe or lose him, but he never saw me till
we got so far I couldn't get back; though he could have dropped me out of the saddle with a
bullet, and had the right to do it.

""When I rode up he only looked at me.  If I had been as small as I felt, he'd never seen me.
He ought to have abused me; but he didn't. He ought to have shot me; but he didn't; or turned
me back and that would have been worse than shooting.  But if he'd been my own father he couldn't
have acted different.  He just told me to come along.""

Laramie paused.  He was speaking under a strain: ""I didn't understand it then; but he knew
it was too late to quarrel.  He knew there was about one chance in a hundred for him to get
through; for me, there was about one in a hundred thousand--in fact, he knew I couldn't get
through, so he didn't abuse me.

"﻿WHAT MAISIE KNEW

by

HENRY JAMES

The litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated; but by the decision on
the appeal the judgement of the divorce-court was confirmed as to the assignment of the child.
The father, who, though bespattered from head to foot, had made good his case, was, in pursuance
of this triumph, appointed to keep her: it was not so much that the mother's character had
been more absolutely damaged as that the brilliancy of a lady's complexion (and this lady's,
in court, was immensely remarked) might be more regarded as showing the spots. Attached, however,
to the second pronouncement was a condition that detracted, for Beale Farange, from its sweetness--an
order that he should refund to his late wife the twenty-six hundred pounds put down by her,
as it was called, some three years before, in the interest of the child's maintenance and precisely
on a proved understanding that he would take no proceedings: a sum of which he had had the
administration and of which he could render not the least account. The obligation thus attributed
to her adversary was no small balm to Ida's resentment; it drew a part of the sting from her
defeat and compelled Mr. Farange perceptibly to lower his crest. He was unable to produce the
money or to raise it in any way; so that after a squabble scarcely less public and scarcely
more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue from his predicament was a compromise
proposed by his legal advisers and finally accepted by hers.

His debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl disposed of in a manner
worthy of the judgement-seat of Solomon. She was divided in two and the portions tossed impartially
to the disputants. They would take her, in rotation, for six months at a time; she would spend
half the year with each. This was odd justice in the eyes of those who still blinked in the
fierce light projected from the tribunal--a light in which neither parent figured in the least
","﻿Joel said calmly: ""That is not so; because we know about--liking each other, already. I know
how it is with you. It is clothes that you are thinking about. Well, you can get them in the
stores. And you have many, already. You have new dresses whenever I see you....""

She laughed gayly. ""But, Joel, you only see me once in three years. Of course I have new dresses,
then. But I just couldn't....""

She laughed again, a faint uneasiness in her laughter. She left his knee, and sat down soberly
beside him. She was feeling a little crushed, smothered ... as though she were being pushed
back against a wall. Joel said steadily:

""Mr. Worthen will be glad to know you go with me. And every one will be glad for you....""

She burst, abruptly, into tears. She was miserable, she told him. He was making her miserable.
She hated to be bullied, and he was trying to bully her. She hated him. She wouldn't marry
him. Never. He could go off on his old ship and never come back. That was all. She would not
go; and he ought not to ask her to, anyway. To prove how much she hated him, she nestled against
his side, and his arm enfolded her.

Joel had not the outward seeming of a wise man; nevertheless he now said:

""The other girls will all be envying you. To be married so quickly, and carried away the very
next day...."" Her sobs miraculously ceased, and he smiled quietly down upon her dark head against
his breast. ""Every one will do things for you.... The whole town.... They will come down to
see us sail away.""

He fell silent, leaving his words for her consideration. She remained very quiet against his
side for a long time, breathing very softly. He thought he could almost read her thoughts....

""It will be,"" he said, ""like a story. Like a romance."" And the word sounded strangely on his
sober lips.

But at the word, the girl sat up quickly, both hands gripping his arm. He could see her eyes
dancing in the moonlight.... ""Oh, Joe,"" she cried, ""it would really be just loads of fun. And

"﻿After reading the brilliant reports in the Chicago papers and seeing the handsome, refined
policemen at the various meetings, I am not surprised that our magazine is being appreciated.
Apropos of the Chicago police, just fancy, I have actually forced them out of their uniforms.
I hope this will not conjure up the horrible picture of Chicago's finest parading the city
in Adam's costume. Not that! Only, Chief of Police Collins was so outraged over my gentle criticism
of his dear little boys at one of the woodworkers' meetings, that he gave strict orders, ""No
officer should again appear at a public meeting in uniform where that awful Emma Goldman is
humiliating and degrading the emblem of authority and law.""

After this, I hope you will never again doubt the importance of public meetings and the great

it must be drained in the colander, thrown into cold water to blanch and become firm, and then
thoroughly heated in a white sauce. If the cold bath is neglected the result will be flat and
discolored instead of white and crisp.

CELERY SOUP.

The ingredients are two heads of celery, one quart of water, one quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls
of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter and a dash of pepper. Wash
and scrape celery and cut in half inch pieces, put in boiling water and cook until soft. Mash
the celery in the water in which it is boiled and add salt and pepper. Let the milk come to
a boil; cream together the butter and flour and stir the boiling milk into it slowly; then
add celery and strain through a sieve mashing and pressing with the back of a spoon until all
but the tough fibres of the celery are squeezed through. Return the soup to the fire and heat
until it is steaming when it is ready to serve.

BOILED CELERIAC.

Pare the roots and throw them into cold water for one half hour. Cut into squares, boil in
salted water until tender and serve with a butter or cream sauce.

CELERIAC SALAD.

Boil the roots in salted water, throw into cold water and peel; slice, serve on lettuce leaves
and pour over a French or mayonnaise dressing. (See Salad Dressing.)

CHERVIL SALAD.

Clean the leaves thoroughly in cold water and shake to drain. Serve with French salad dressing.
The leaves are aromatic and are used for seasoning dressings, salads, sauces and soups and
also for garnishes.

CREAM CHICORY.

Clean well and boil several heads of chicory, drain and cool; squeeze out the water from the
chicory and mince it; melt some butter in a saucepan and cook until the moisture has evaporated;
sprinkle with flour and add hot milk; boil up stirring all the time; season, and cook on back
of the stove fifteen minutes; serve with croutons or bits of toast.

Both were occupied with their own thoughts, and strange thoughts they must have been. They

We have had very good luck, and made a most successful trip to Carpentaria, and back to where
we had every right to consider ourselves safe, having left a depot here consisting of four
men, twelve horses, and six camels. They had provisions enough to have lasted them twelve months
with proper economy, and we had also every right to expect that we should have been immediately
followed up from Menindie by another party with additional provisions and every necessary for
forming a permanent depot at Cooper's Creek. The party we left here had special instructions

    THE AUTHOR: Sami Hamarneh is the curator of the Division of
    Medical Sciences in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of
    History and Technology.

By the early 1870's, leading figures from both the health professions and the general public
had begun to realize the necessity for having the medical sciences represented in the Smithsonian
Institution. The impetus behind this new feeling resulted from the action of a distinguished
American physician, philanthropist, and author, Joseph Meredith Toner (1825-1896), and came
almost a decade before the integration of a new section concerned with research and the historical
and educational aspects of the healing arts in the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1872, Dr. Toner established the ""Toner Lectures"" to encourage efforts towards discovering
new truths ""for the advancement of medical science ... for the benefit of mankind."" To finance
these lectures, he provided a fund worth approximately $3,000 to be administered by a board
of trustees consisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Surgeon General
of the U.S. Navy, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army (only in some years), and the president
of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia. The interest from this fund was to compensate
physicians and scholars who were to deliver ""at least two annual memoirs or essays"" based on
original research on some branch of the medical sciences and containing information which had
been verified ""by experiments or observations.""[1]

Little need be said, by way of explanation, for the addition of the present subject to our
collection of the birthplaces of eminent men. It is something to know that John Scott was born
at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the principal dwelling represented in the above Engraving, in the
year 1751; that he received the rudiments of his education at the free grammar-school of the
town; that he grew up ""a man of safe discretion;"" that he enjoyed the highest legal honours
which his sovereign could bestow for a quarter of a century; and that he still lives, a venerable
octogenarian, in the enjoyment of ""glory from his conscience, and honour from men."" The biography
of so distinguished an individual must have innumerable good tendencies: it at once inculcates
the wholesome truth that ""every man is the architect of his own fortune;"" and it presents us,
moreover, with the encouraging picture of a well-regulated life, and its healthful energies
so employed in the discharge of important duties as to entitle the subject to high rank among
the worthies of his country.

John Scott, Lord Eldon, is the third son of William Scott, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. ""His father
was by trade what in the language of the place is called a 'fitter,' or agent for the sale
and shipment of coals. He had by industry and habits of close saving accumulated rather considerable
means from small beginnings. Beyond this he was a man of great shrewdness and knowledge of
the world,"" and quickly perceiving the talents of the two younger boys, William (now Lord Stowell,)
and John, he wisely gave them an education in accordance with their mental endowments. ""It

"﻿A few years before this the leading women in French society showed a nobility of character
and a simplicity in dress worthy of Roman matrons. Of these were Madame Boland and Madame Desmoulins;
but now all was changed. At the head of society stood Madame Tallien and others like her, wild
in extravagance, daily seeking new refinements in luxury, and demanding of their husbands and
lovers vast sums to array them and to feed their whims. If such sums could not be obtained
honestly they must be had dishonestly. The more closely one examines that period, the more
clearly he sees that the pictures, given by Thibaudeau and Challamel and De Goncourt are not
at all exaggerated. [78]

The contrast between these gay creatures of the Directory period and the people at large was
striking. Indeed much as the vast majority of the wealthy classes suffered from impoverishment,
the laboring classes, salaried employees of all sorts, and people of fixed income and of small
means, especially in the cities, underwent yet greater distress. These were found, as a rule,
to subsist mainly on daily government rations of bread at the rate of one pound per person.
This was frequently unfit for food and was distributed to long lines of people, men, women
and children, who were at times obliged to wait their turn even from dawn to dusk. The very
rich could, by various means, especially by bribery, obtain better bread, but only at enormous
cost. In May, 1796, the market price of good bread was, in paper, 80 francs (16 dollars) per
pound and a little later provisions could not be bought for paper money at any price. [79]

And here it may be worth mentioning that there was another financial trouble especially vexatious.
While, as we have seen, such enormous sums, rising from twenty to forty thousand millions of
francs in paper, were put in circulation by the successive governments of the Revolution, enormous
sums had been set afloat in counterfeits by criminals and by the enemies of France. These ca","﻿At length, through the various turnings and windings of a long and romantic path, Mowbray found
himself, without having received any satisfactory intelligence, by the side of the brook, called
St. Ronan's Burn, at the place where it was crossed by foot-passengers, by the Clattering Brig,
and by horsemen through a ford a little lower. At this point the fugitive might have either
continued her wanderings through her paternal woods, by a path which, after winding about a
mile, returned to Shaws-Castle, or she might have crossed the bridge, and entered a broken
horse-way, common to the public, leading to the Aultoun of St. Ronan's.

Mowbray, after a moment's consideration, concluded that the last was her most probable option.--He
mounted his horse, which the groom had brought down according to order, and commanding the
man to return by the footpath, which he himself could not examine, he proceeded to ride towards
the ford. The brook was swollen during the night, and the groom could not forbear intimating
to his master, that there was considerable danger in attempting to cross it. But Mowbray's
mind and feelings were too high-strung to permit him to listen to cautious counsel. He spurred
the snorting and reluctant horse into the torrent, though the water, rising high on the upper
side, broke both over the pommel and the croupe of his saddle. It was by exertion of great
strength and sagacity, that the good horse kept the ford-way. Had the stream forced him down
among the rocks, which lie below the crossing-place, the consequences must have been fatal.
Mowbray, however, reached the opposite side in safety, to the joy and admiration of the servant,
who stood staring at him during the adventure. He then rode hastily towards the Aultoun, determined,
if he could not hear tidings of his sister in that village, that he would spread the alarm,
and institute a general search after her, since her elopement from Shaws-Castle could, in that
case, no longer be concealed. We must leav",False,none

I CAN not more appropriately introduce the Cosmos than by presenting a brief sketch of the
life of its illustrious author.*  While the name of Alexander von Humboldt is familiar to every
one, few, perhaps, are aware of the peculiar circumstances of his scientific career and of
the extent of his labors in almost every department of physical knowledge.  He was born on
the 14th of September, 1769, and is, therefore, now in his 80th year.  After going through
the ordinary course of education at Gottingen, and having made a rapid tour through Holland,
England, and France, he became a pupil of Werner at the mining school of Freyburg, and in his
21st year published an ""Essay on the Basalts of the Rhine.""  Though he soon became officially
connected with the mining corps, he was enabled to continue his excursions in foreign countries,
for, during the six or seven years succeeding the publication of his first essay, he seems
to have visited Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France.  His attention to mining did not,
however, prevent him from devoting his attention to other scientific pursuits, among which
botany and the then recent discovery of galvanism may be especially noticed.  Botany, indeed,

                               PREFACE

The fifteenth century may be regarded as a period of transition from the ideals of the Middle
Ages to those of modern times. The world was fast becoming more secular in its tendencies,
and, as a necessary result, theories and principles that had met till then with almost universal
acceptance in literature, in art, in education, and in government, were challenged by many
as untenable.

Scholasticism, which had monopolised the attention of both schools and scholars since the days
of St. Anselm and Abelard, was called upon to defend its claims against the advocates of classical
culture; the theocratico-imperial conception of Christian society as expounded by the canonists
and lawyers of an earlier period was forced into the background by the appearance of nationalism
and individualism, which by this time had become factors to be reckoned with by the ecclesiastical
and civil rulers; the Feudal System, which had received a mortal blow by the intermingling
of the classes and the masses in the era of the Crusades, was threatened, from above, by the
movement towards centralisation and absolutism, and from below, by the growing discontent of
the peasantry and artisans, who had begun to realise, but as yet only in a vague way, their
own strength. In every department the battle for supremacy was being waged between the old
and the new, and the printing-press was at hand to enable the patrons of both to mould the
thoughts and opinions of the Christian world.

It was, therefore, an age of unrest and of great intellectual activity, and at all such times
the claims of the Church as the guardian and expounder of Divine Revelation are sure to be
questioned. Not that the Church has need to fear inquiry, or that the claims of faith and reason
are incompatible, but because some daring spirits are always to be reckoned with, who, by mistaking
hypotheses for facts, succeed in convincing themselves and their followers ","﻿The Ranch in the Rockies

    THE AUTHOR: Edwin A. Battison is associate curator of mechanical

Directness and simplicity characterize pioneer machine tools because they were intended to
accomplish some quite specialized task and the need for versatility was not apparent. History
does not reveal the earliest forms of any primitive machines nor does it reveal much about
the various early stages in evolution toward more complex types. At best we have discovered
and dated certain developments as existing in particular areas. Whether these forms were new
at the time they were first found or how widely dispersed such forms may have been is unknown.
Surviving evidence is in the form of pictures or drawings, such as the little-known screw-cutting
lathe of 1483 (fig. 1) shown in Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch.

This lathe shows that its builder had a keen perception of the necessary elements, reduced
to bare essentials, required to accomplish the object. Present are the coordinate slides often
credited to Henry Maudslay. His slides are not, of course, associated with the spindle; neither
is there any natural law which compels them to guide the tool exactly parallel with the axis
of revolution. In this sense the screw-cutting lathe in the Hausbuch is superior because it
is in harmony with natural law and can generate a true cylinder, whereas Maudslay's lathe can
only transfer to the work whatever accuracy is built into it.

EDUCATION AS SERVICE

INTRODUCTION

In long past lives the author of this little book had much to do with educational work, and
he seems to have brought over with him an intense interest in education. During his short visits
to Benares, he paid an alert attention to many of the details of the work carried on in the
Central Hindu College, observing and asking questions, noting the good feeling between teachers
and students, so different from his own school experiences in Southern India. He appears to
have been brooding over the question, and has, in this booklet, held up the educational ideals
which appear to him to be necessary for the improvement of the present system.

The position of the teacher must be raised to that which it used to occupy in India, so that
to sit in the teacher's chair will be a badge of social honour. His work must be seen as belonging
to the great Teaching Department in the Government of our world, and his relation with his
pupils must be a copy of the relation between a Master and His disciples. Love, protective
and elevating on the one side, must be met with love, confiding and trustful on the other.
This is, in truth, the old Hindu ideal, exaggerated as it may seem to be to-day and if it be
possible, in any country to rebuild this ideal, it should be by an Indian for Indians. Hence
there is, at the back of the author's mind, a dream of a future College and School, wherein
this ideal may be materialised--a Theosophical College and School, because the ancient Indian
ideals now draw their life from Theosophy which alone can shape the new vessels for the ancient
elixir of life Punishment must disappear--not only the old brutality of the cane, but all the
forms of coercion that make hypocrites instead of honourable and manly youths. The teacher
must embody the ideal, and the boy be drawn, by admiration and love, to copy it. Those who
know how swiftly the un",False,none

""self made man""; si llegó a conquistar fama y rango, no fue tan sólo por su talento original
y su vasta ilustración, sino también por sus ejemplares virtudes públicas y privadas.

Cursó estudios secundarios en el Colegio Nacional de Mendoza; allí encabezó una revuelta estudiantil
para obtener reformas de la enseñanza y cambios en las autoridades docentes. En 1876 se trasladó
a Buenos Aires, ingresando al Colegio Militar; en 1883 emprendió estudios universitarios, graduándose
en Derecho en 1888. Fue Juez en lo civil, en Mendoza (1889-1890) y Diputado por esa provincia
al Congreso Nacional (1892-1896). Su doble competencia militar y forense lo llevó al cargo
de vocal letrado del Consejo Supremo de Guerra y Marina (1896-1906). Durante los últimos quince

A SCHOOL STORY

Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. 'At our school,' said
A., 'we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. What was it like? Oh, very unconvincing. Just
the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I remember right. The staircase was a stone one.
I never heard any story about the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why
didn't somebody invent one, I wonder?'

'You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own. There's a subject
for you, by the way--""The Folklore of Private Schools"".'

'Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to investigate the cycle of

"﻿The Long Range Excavator Rock-Crushing and Gold-Winning Company was born from the brain of
Aurophilus Dobrown, Esq., of Smallchange Dell, in the county of Middlesex, between the hours
of ten and eleven at night on the 14th of October 1851. It was at first a shapeless and unpromising
bantling; but being introduced to the patronage of a conclave of experienced drynurses, it
speedily became developed in form and proportion; and before it was ten days old, was formally
introduced, with official garniture, to the expectant public, by whom it was received with
general approbation and favour. The new company, in a dashing prospectus, held forth a certain
prospect of enormous advantages to shareholders, with an entire exemption from responsibility
of every sort. The shares were a million in number, at one pound each, without any further
call--on the loose-cash principle, and no signing of documents. Aurophilus Dobrown was chairman
of the committee of management.

The intentions of the company, as detailed at length in their eloquent prospectus, were to
invade the gold regions of the Australian continent with a monster engine, contrived by the
indefatigable Crushcliff, and which, it was confidently expected, would devour the soil of
the auriferous district at a rate averaging about three tons per minute. It was furnished,
so the engineer averred, with a stomach of 250 tons capacity, supplied with peristaltic grinders
of steel of the most obdurate temper, enabling it with ease to digest the hardest granite rocks,
to crush the masses of quartz into powder, and to deposit the virgin gold upon a sliding floor
underneath. The machine was to be set in motion by the irresistible force of 'the pressure
from without,' and 1000 pounds-weight of pure gold per diem was considered a very low estimate
of its powers of production. These reasonable expectations being modestly set forth in circulars
and public advertisements, and backed by the august patronage of the respectable and respons","﻿VALLEY of the CROEN

By LEE TARBELL

    There was a mysterious golden statue that always pointed one
    way--and it led to sudden death in the valley where flying disks
    landed.

They say cross-eyed men are bad luck. He stood there, in my doorway, eyeing me up and down
with those in-focused black eyes.

His face was hideous even if the eyes had been normal. He was slashed with a wide cicatrice
of livid scar tissue from one cheekbone across his nose and down to the button of his jaw on
the other side.

He was big, and he looked like bad news to me. I inadvertently moved the door as if to close
it, then he spoke:

""You Keele, the mining man?""

I nodded, wondering at the mild voice from the huge battered figure.

""Been looking for you. I've run across something I wouldn't tell just anyone. But I've heard
of you, that you are on the level. Here in Korea, you're known already.""

I still didn't step back and swing the door wide. But he had aroused my curiosity as well as
my natural desire to acquire things. I had made two fortunes and lost both in mining ventures.
My present not small income came from an emerald mine in the Andes. It had been a very dirty
and very sick Indio who had led me to that emerald mine. You never know!

""I'm pretty busy, could you give me some idea...."" I hedged. It doesn't do to seem too anxious
or eager in any business deal. Too, the sight of his burly figure, even without the nightmare
face, was not exactly reassuring. That bulge under the native quilted coat, I knew was nothing
but a gun too big for even his bulges to conceal completely. But a man needed a gun, here.
Especially if he had something valuable, such as the whereabouts of gold.

He grinned, and the white, even teeth, and the wrinkles around his eyes took away the sense
of impending catastrophe brought by those crossed eyes. I stepped back then, and he walked

experiencing. She trusted Mrs. Upton, were she right, or were she wrong, and there was an end
of it. With that final realization she uncovered her eyes and met her hostess's eyes again,
eyes so soft, so clear, but with, in them, a look of suffering. Childlike, her hair folding
behind her cheek and neck, she was faded, touched with age; Mary had never seen it so clearly.
Somehow it made her even sorrier than the suffering she recognized.

PREFACE.

-:0:-

THE  ORIGINAL  EDITION of this work appeared in 1879, fifteen years ago.  It was well received
by the press, by the clan, and by all interested in  the history of the Highlands.  The best
proof of this is the fact that the  book has for several years been out of print, occasional
second-hand copies of it coming into the market selling at a high premium on the original subscription
price.

Personally, however, I was never satisfied with it.  It was my first clan history, and to say
nothing of inevitable defects of style by a comparatively inexperienced hand, it was for several
other reasons necessarily incomplete, and in many respects not what I should wish the history
of my own clan to be.

This edition, which extends to close upon two hundred pages  more than its predecessor, has
an accurate and well-executed plate of the clan tartan, and a life-like portrait of the Author;
has been almost entirely re-written; contains several families omitted from the first; has
all been  carefully revised; and although not even now absolutely perfect, I believe  it is
almost as near being so as it is possible for any work which contains such an enormous number
of dates and other details as this one to be.

The mythical Fitzgerald origin of the clan, hitherto accepted by most of its leading members,
is exhaustively dealt with, I venture to hope effectively, if not comple","﻿Here a whistle from the coffee-room window startled them. Even so rude a being as a man is
sometimes mindful of his dog. In an instant both concierge and stranger were on their feet,
the concierge ready for whatever would turn up, the stranger trying to locate the sound and
his master. Another whistle, and he was off, bounding down the road, looking wistfully at the
windows, and rushing back bewildered. Suddenly it came to him that the short cut to his master
lay through the archway.

Just here there was a change in the manner of the concierge. It was not gruff, nor savage,
nor severe,--it was only firm and decided. With his tail still wagging, showing his kindness
and willingness to oblige, but with spine rigid and hair bristling, he explained clearly and
succinctly to that strange dog how absolutely impossible it would be for him to permit his
crossing the archway. Up went the spine of the stranger, and out went his tail like a bar of
steel, the feet braced, and the whole body taut as standing rigging. But the concierge kept
on wagging his tail, though his hair still bristled,--saying as plainly as he could:--

""My dear sir, do not blame me. I assure you that nothing in the world would give me more pleasure
than to throw the whole house open to you; but consider for a moment. My master puts me here
to see that nobody enters the inn but those whom he wishes to see, and that all other live-stock,
especially dogs, shall on no account be admitted."" (This with head bent on one side and neck
arched.) ""Now, while I have the most distinguished consideration for your dogship"" (tail wagging
violently), ""and would gladly oblige you, you must see that my honor is at stake"" (spine more
rigid), ""and I feel assured that under the circumstances you will not press a request (low
growl) which you must know would be impossible for me to grant.""

And the strange dog, gentleman as he was, expressed himself as entirely satisfied with the
very free and generous explanation. With tail w",False,none

of Croker's edition of Boswell's Johnson, ""with numerous additions and notes,"" excited a prolonged

having contributed elucidations to the text, but for having mutilated it by insertions which

only to look at the patient and he knew his condition at once, and if he would recover, or
must needs die."" So they said of him, and from far and wide people came to him, sent for him
when they had any one ill, and gave him so much money that he soon became a rich man. Now it
so befell that the King became ill, and the physician was summoned, and was to say if recovery
were possible. But when he came to the bed, Death was standing by the feet of the sick man,
and the herb did not grow which could save him. ""If I could but cheat Death for once,"" thought
the physician, ""he is sure to take it ill if I do, but, as I am his godson, he will shut one
eye; I will risk it."" He therefore took up the sick man, and laid him the other way, so that
now Death was standing by his head. Then he gave the King some of the herb, and he recovered
and grew healthy again. But Death came to the physician, looking very black and angry, threatened
him with his finger, and said, ""Thou hast overreached me; this time I will pardon it, as thou
art my godson; but if thou venturest it again, it will cost thee thy neck, for I will take
thee thyself away with me.""

Soon afterwards the King's daughter fell into a severe illness. She was his only child, and
he wept day and night, so that he began to lose the sight of his eyes, and he caused it to
be made known that whosoever rescued her from death should be her husband and inherit the crown.
When the physician came to the sick girl's bed, he saw Death by her feet. He ought to have
remembered the warning given by his godfather, but he was so infatuated by the great beauty
of the King's daughter, and the happiness of becoming her husband, that he flung all thought
to the winds. He did not see that Death was casting angry glances on him, that he was raising
his hand in the air, and threatening him with his withered fist. He raised up the sick girl,

by William Dean Howells

AMERICAN LITERARY CENTRES

One of the facts which we Americans have a difficulty in making clear to a rather inattentive
world outside is that, while we have apparently a literature of our own, we have no literary
centre. We have so much literature that from time to time it seems even to us we must have
a literary centre. We say to ourselves, with a good deal of logic, Where there is so much smoke
there must be some fire, or at least a fireplace. But it is just here that, misled by tradition,
and even by history, we deceive ourselves. Really, we have no fireplace for such fire as we
have kindled; or, if any one is disposed to deny this, then I say, we have a dozen fireplaces;
which is quite as bad, so far as the notion of a literary centre is concerned, if it is not worse.

I once proved this fact to my own satisfaction in some papers which I wrote several years ago;
but it appears, from a question which has lately come to me from England, that I did not carry
conviction quite so far as that island; and I still have my work all before me, if I understand
the London friend who wishes ""a comparative view of the centres of literary production"" among
us; ""how and why they change; how they stand at present; and what is the relation, for instance,
of Boston to other such centres.""

I.

Here, if I cut my coat according to my cloth, t should have a garment which this whole volume
would hardly stuff out with its form; and I have a fancy that if I begin by answering, as I
have sometimes rather too succinctly done, that we have no more a single literary centre than
Italy or than Germany has (or had before their unification), I shall not be taken at my word.
I shall be right, all the same, and if I am told that in those countries there is now a tendency
to such a centre, I can only say that there is none in this, and that, so far as I can see,
we get further every day from having such a centre. The fault,",False,none
"﻿Mrs. Woodward did write him a very kind letter, and it did comfort him. And she wrote also,
as she was bound to do, a letter of congratulation to Alaric. This letter, though it expressed
in the usual terms the satisfaction which one friend has in another's welfare, was not written
in the same warm affectionate tone as that to Norman. Alaric perceived instantly that it was
not cordial. He loved Mrs. Woodward dearly, and greatly desired her love and sympathy. But
what then? He could not have everything. He determined, therefore, not to trouble his mind.
If Mrs. Woodward did not sympathize with him, others of the family would do so; and success
would ultimately bring her round. What woman ever yet refused to sympathize with successful
ambition?

Alaric also received a letter from Captain Cuttwater, in which that gallant veteran expressed
his great joy at the result of the examination--'Let the best man win all the world over,'
said he, 'whatever his name is. And they'll have to make the same rule at the Admiralty too.
The days of the Howards are gone by; that is, unless they can prove themselves able seamen,
which very few of them ever did yet. Let the best man win; that's what I say; and let every
man get his fair share of promotion.' Alaric did not despise the sympathy of Captain Cuttwater.
It might turn out that even Captain Cuttwater could be made of use.

Mrs. Woodward's letter to Harry was full of the tenderest affection. It was a flattering, soothing,
loving letter, such as no man ever could have written. It was like oil poured into his wounds,
and made him feel that the world was not all harsh to him. He had determined not to go to Hampton
that Saturday; but Mrs. Woodward's letter almost made him rush there at once that he might
throw himself into her arms--into her arms, and at her daughter's feet. The time had now come
to him when he wanted to be comforted by the knowledge that his love was returned. He resolved
that during his next visit he would formally p","﻿""Don't try to deceive these people.  We don't put on style and wear store clothes like you

What did this same magnanimous Republican party that General Fry had told you so much about
do with General Robert E. Lee?  I knew General Lee, I served with him in Mexico, and although

after he had surrendered at Appomattox, and his men had all laid down their arms, what did
this same magnanimous party that General Fry talked so much about do with General Lee?  Why,
they tried him by a drumhead court-martial and shot and quartered him right on the spot!""

Again interrupting, General Fry indignantly exclaimed:

""It is an outrage, Colonel Woolford, to attempt to deceive these people by such statements.
General Lee was never even imprisoned, and is still alive, the president of a college in Virginia,
and highly esteemed by everybody.""

The Colonel answered:

""Now, General Fry, you have been treated like a gentleman ever since you came to these mountains;
we gave you the best we had to eat, gave you the last drop out of the bottle, and listened
quietly to you just as long as you wanted to speak.  We don't wear Sunday clothes, General
Fry, like you do down in Danville, but just live in our plain way in our log cabins, and eat
our hoe-cake, and say our prayers, but if there is anything on God's earth that we do love,
it is the truth.  It is wrong for you, General Fry, to try and fool these people.  Yes, this

"﻿Transcriber's notes

      1. The Russian names normally do not have any accents; in this
      book they appear to represent the emphasized syllable. The use
      of accents has been standardized, with exception of Alexander
      vs. Alexánder.

      2. Corrected the division into stanzas for a poem ""God"" (O Thou
      eternal One! whose presence bright) on page 94. The translator
      used nine lines where ten lines were used in the original
      Russian poem.

      3. Several misprints and punctuation errors corrected. A list of
      corrections can be found at the end of the text.

a curious fact that the French clergy took greatly to card-playing about that time--their favourite
game being the rather ungenteel 'All Fours,' as now reputed; for they were specially forbidden
that pastime by the Synod of Langres in 1404.

The ancient cards of both Spain and France, particularly the 'court-cards,' exhibit strong
marks of the age of chivalry; but here we may observe that the word is written by some ancient
writers, 'coate-cards,' evidently signifying no more than figures in particular dresses. The
giving pre-eminence or victory to a certain suit, by the name of 'trump,' which is only a corruption
of the word 'triumph,' is a strong trait of the martial ideas of the inventors of these games.
So that, if the Chinese started the idea, it seems clear that the French and Spanish improved
upon it and gave it a plain significance; and there is no reason to doubt that cards were actually
employed to amuse Charles VI. in his melancholy and dejection.

The four suits of cards are supposed to represent the four estates of a kingdom:--1. The nobility
and gentry; 2. The ecclesiastics or priesthood; 3. The citizens or commercial men; 4. The peasantry
or Husbandmen. The nobility are represented in the old Spanish cards by the espada, or sword,
corrupted by us into 'spades,'--by the French with piques, 'pikes or spears.' The ecclesiastical
order is pointed out by copas, or sacramental cups, which are painted in one of the suits of
old Spanish cards, and by coeurs, or 'hearts,' on French cards, as in our own--thereby signifying
choir-men, gens de choeur, or ecclesiastics--from choeur de l'eglise, 'the choir of the church,'
that being esteemed the most important part or the HEART of the church.

The Spaniards depicted their citizens or commercial men under dineros, a small coin, an emblem
very well adapted to the productive classes; the French by carreaux, squares or lozenges-",False,none

Eine Woche später traf ihn Rolfers hinten im Moor, den Waldrand skizzierend. Er hockte auf
seinem Malerschemel, wunderlich ungeschickt. Beim Näherkommen bemerkte Rolfers, daß der Junge
sich mit Bindfaden den rechten Arm auf den Rücken festgebunden hatte. Er ließ den Skizzenblock
fallen, als er Rolfers auf dem schmalen Wege nahen sah, und wollte davonlaufen. Aber er warf
den Malschemel dabei um und die Fußbank, die er für Farben und Pinsel herbeigeschleppt hatte,

»Junge – verdrehter, toller Bengel!«

»Ich will nichts Besseres haben als Sie!« schrie er leidenschaftlich, und die Tränen sprangen
ihm wie Blitze aus den hellen Augen hervor.

Rolfers hatte ihm den linken Arm um den Hals gelegt und hielt ihn so, damit er ihm nicht davonrannte.
Und legte seine Wange auf des Knaben Kopf, auf sein hartes Bürstenhaar.

A week later he met Rolfers back in the bog, the forest edge sketching. He squatted on his painting
stool, awkwardly strange. On closer Rolfers noticed that the boy had been bound with twine to
the right arm on the back.

He left the sketchbook Fall when he saw Rolf on the narrow paths
nearby, and wanted to run away.

But he threw the Malschemel it around and the footstool, which he had dragged for paints and
brushes and was now ashamed, tugging at his restraint.

""Boy - twisted, great kid!""

       ""I want to have anything better than you,"" he cried passionately,
and the tears sprang him like lightning from the bright eyes shine.

Rolfers had put his left arm around the neck and held him so that he may not like him ran.
And his cheek laid on the boy's head, hard to brush his hair.

""My boy, my dear boy!""

Nothing more was said about the case between them.

                     PROVEN RECIPES FOR TRADITIONAL
                        PENNSYLVANIA Dutch FOODS

PENNSYLVANIA Dutch COOKERY

In 1683 the Plain Sects began to arrive in William Penn’s Colony seeking a land of peace and
plenty. They were a mixed people; Moravians from Bohemia and Moravia, Mennonites from Switzerland
and Holland, the Amish, the Dunkards, the Schwenkfelds, and the French Huguenots. After the
lean years of clearing the land and developing their farms they established the peace and plenty
they sought. These German-speaking people were originally called the Pennsylvania Deutsch but
time and custom have caused them to be known to us as the Pennsylvania Dutch.

The Pennsylvania Dutch are a hard working people and as they say, “Them that works hard, eats
hearty.” The blending of recipes from their many home lands and the ingredients available in
their new land produced tasty dishes that have been handed down from mother to daughter for
generations. Their cooking was truly a folk art requiring much intuitive knowledge, for recipes
contained measurements such as “flour to stiffen,” “butter the size of a walnut,” and “large
as an apple.” Many of the recipes have been made more exact and standardized providing us with
a regional cookery we can all enjoy.

Soups are a traditional part of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking and the Dutch housewife can apparently
make soup out of anything. If she has only milk and flour she can still make rivel soup. However,
most of their soups are sturdier dishes, hearty enough to serve as the major portion of the
evening meal. One of the favorite summer soups in the Pennsylvania Dutch country is Chicken
Corn Soup. Few Sunday School picnic suppers would be considered complete without gallons of
this hearty soup.

Many of the Pennsylvania Dutch foods are a part of th","﻿The question of what is ""school age"" for a deaf child is answered very differently by different
people. Most of the state institutions for the deaf in the United States, Canada, and Europe
will not admit children younger than six years of age. Seven years is still the age of admission
in some institutions, but the tendency is to lower the age limit. In some schools children
of five are admitted, in a few those as young as four, and in two or three small schools babies
of two and three are received. Any statement here must, therefore, be taken as only the expression
of the author's opinion, resulting from more than twenty-five years of active teaching, combined
with wide observation.

It would appear that, where home conditions are not bad, either physically or morally, the
proper place for the little deaf child till he is nearly, or quite, five, is with his mother.
Very much can be done for the little one before he is five to prepare him for the instruction
which should be given at that age, but it is possible for the mother to do what is necessary,
and even the simplest home conditions are preferable for very little children to the institutional
environment. It is impossible, in a school of from one hundred to five hundred pupils, to create
a real home environment, such as the very little child should have. It is really a pity that
the child of five should have to be placed in the institutional environment as it at present
exists. If the legislative bodies of our states, and the gentlemen who manage the schools,
could only be induced to adopt the cottage plan of housing in small units, the disadvantages
of institutional life would be enormously reduced.

""I'll be here.""

The two walked together to the driveway, and shortly the mellow note of the great Panhard's
horn sounded, as the automobile rounded the curve of The Bow and sped away to the north shore
highway and the sheds.

Late that afternoon Aileen, with her baby daughter, Aurora, in her arms, was standing on the
porch watching for her husband's return. The usual hour for his home-coming had long passed.
She began to fear that the threatened trouble in the sheds, on account of the attempted introduction
of the automatic bush hammer, might have come to a crisis. At last, however, she saw him leave
the car and cross the bridge over the Rothel. His step was quick and firm. She waved her hand
to him; a swing of his cap answered her. Then little Aurora's tiny fist was manipulated by
her mother to produce a baby form of welcome.

Champney sprang up the steps two at a time, and for a moment the little wife and baby Aurora
disappeared in his arms.

""Oh, Champney, I'm so thankful you've come! I knew just by the way you came over the bridge
that things were going better at the sheds. You are so late I began to get worried. Come, supper's
waiting.""

""Wait a minute, Aileen--Mother--"" he called through the hall, ""come here a minute, please.""

Aurora Googe came quickly at that ever welcome call. Her face was even more beautiful than
formerly, for great joy and peace irradiated every feature.

""Where's Honoré?"" he said abruptly, looking about for his boy who was generally the first to
run as far as the bridge to greet him. His wife answered.

""He and Billy went with Father Honoré as far as the power-house; he'll be back soon with Billy.
Sister Ste. Croix went by a few mi","﻿He was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared a little wider and more
worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the knight to understand that he was in the vicinity
of some chapel or hermitage.

Accordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side of which, a rock, rising
abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller.
Ivy mantled its sides in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found
nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below, like the plumage of
the warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to that whose chief expression was terror.
At the bottom of the rock, and leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut,
built chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and secured against
the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss mingled with clay. The stem of a young
fir-tree lopped of its branches, with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted
upright by the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right
hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received in a hollow
stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured
down the descent by a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the little
plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.

Beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which the roof had partly fallen
in. The building, when entire, had never been above sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth,
and the roof, low in proportion, rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from the four
corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy pillar. The ribs of two of these
arches remained, though the roof had fallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained
entire. The entrance to this ancient place of d",False,none

Der alte Mann liess sich auf einen Stuhl sinken und bedeckte sein Gesicht mit beiden Haenden.
""Geh in deine Kammer"", murmelte er; ""ich will allein sein.""

Aber ich ging nicht. ""Lass mich bei dir bleiben"", sagte ich leise. Mein Vater hoerte nicht
auf mich; er erhob den Kopf und schien nach draussen hinzuhorchen. Ploetzlich sprang er auf.
""Still!"" rief er, ""hoerst du's?"" und sah mich mit weit offenen"," ""What is it! How do you come here?"" said it

I looked at my father, he had knocked down his eyes and stood motionless.

""It left I could not rest, ""I said,"" I was that I was needed here, as I would have to be you.

The old man let himself sink into a chair and covered his face with both hands. ""Go into your room,""
he murmured, ""I want to be alone.""

But I did not go. ""Let me stay with you,"" I said softly. My father heard to me, he raised his
head and seemed to listen to outside. Suddenly he jumped up. ""Hush!"" he cried, ""do you hear
it?"" and looked at me with eyes wide open.

I stepped to the window and looked out. It was all dead and silent, only the elder branches
proposed to move from the night wind, against each other. ""I hear nothing!"" I said.

My father was still sleeping when he heard on something that filled
him with horror.

""I said it was no sin, ""he said to himself,"" there is no wickedness
here, and the fountain is, until now at least, on my bottom.

""Then he turned to me.""

"﻿The project of constructing a bridge at this place, where the rocky banks of the Wear rise
to a great height oh both sides of the river, is due to Rowland Burdon, Esq., of Castle Eden,
under whom Mr. T. Wilson served as engineer in carrying out his design. The details differed
in several important respects from the proposed bridge of Paine, Mr. Burdon introducing several
new and original features, more particularly as regarded the framed iron panels radiating towards
the centre in the form of voussoirs, for the purpose of resisting compression.  Mr. Phipps,
C.E., in a report prepared by him at the instance of the late Robert Stephenson, under whose
superintendence the bridge was recently repaired, observes, with respect to the original design,--""We
should probably make a fair division of the honour connected with this unique bridge, by conceding
to Burdon all that belongs to a careful elaboration and improvement upon the designs of another,
to the boldness of taking upon himself the great responsibility of applying.  this idea at
once on so magnificent a scale, and to his liberality and public spirit in furnishing the requisite
funds [to the amount of 22,000L.]; but we must not deny to Paine the credit of conceiving the
construction of iron bridges of far larger span than had been made before his time, or of the
important examples both as models and large constructions which he caused to be made and publicly
exhibited.  In whatever shares the merit of this great work may be apportioned, it must be
admitted to be one of the earliest and greatest triumphs of the art of bridge construction.""
Its span exceeded that of any arch then known, being 236 feet, with a rise of 34 feet, the
springing commencing at 95 feet above the bed of the river; and its height was such as to allow
vessels of 300 tons burden to sail underneath without striking their masts. Mr. Stephenson
characterised the bridge as ""a structure which, as regards its proportions and the small quantity

". Of especial value we reckon the reminiscences
of Allston and his methods; and it seems a little singular, since the scene is laid chiefly
in Florence and in 1847, that we get nothing more satisfactory than a single anecdote about
the elder Greenough, whose life and works and thoroughly emancipated style of thought have
done more to honor American Art than those of any other man, except Allston.

We rather regret that the author had not made his book more of a journal, and recorded directly
his own impressions, because he shows a decided ability in bringing scenes before the eye of
the reader. The sketches of Doney's Caffè and the Venetian improvvisatore are especially vivid;
so is that of the old picture-dealer; though in all we think some of the phrases might have
been softened with advantage. We enter our earnest protest also against the Ruskin chapter.
The scenes at Graefenberg are fresh, lively, and interesting. The book is also enlivened by
many entertaining anecdotes of living American artists and savans, which are told with the
skill of a practised raconteur. We hope to hear from the author again, and in a form which
shall enable his knowledge and experience in matters of Art to have freer play than the exigencies
of a novel allow them, and in which his abilities in the discussion of aesthetics shall have
more scope given them than that of the obiter dicta in a story.

"﻿With the exceptions of portions of California, Arizona, and Texas the average annual surface
temperature of the dry-farm territory of the United States ranges from 40 deg to 55 deg F.
The average is not far from 45 deg F. This places most of the dry-farm territory in the class
of cold regions, though a small area on the extreme east border may be classed as temperate,
and parts of California and Arizona as warm. The range in temperature from the highest in summer
to the lowest in winter is considerable, but not widely different from other similar parts
of the United States. The range is greatest in the interior mountainous districts, and lowest
along the seacoast. The daily range of the highest and lowest temperatures for any one day
is generally higher over dry-farm sections than over humid districts. In the Plateau regions
of the semiarid country the average daily variation is from 30 to 35 deg F., while east of
the Mississippi it is only about 20 deg F. This greater daily range is chiefly due to the clear
skies and scant vegetation which facilitate excessive warming by day and cooling by night.

The important temperature question for the dry-farmer is whether the growing season is sufficiently
warm and long to permit the maturing of crops. There are few places, even at high altitudes
in the region considered, where the summer temperature is so low as to retard the growth of
plants. Likewise, the first and last killing frosts are ordinarily so far apart as to allow
an ample growing season. It must be remembered that frosts are governed very largely by local
topographic features, and must be known from a local point of view. It is a general law that
frosts are more likely to occur in valleys than on hillsides, owing to the downward drainage
of the cooled air. Further, the danger of frost increases with the altitude. In general, the
last killing frost in spring over the dry-farm territory varies from March 15 to May 29, and
the first killing frost in autumn from Se","﻿""You've treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain't the man to hurt your feelings intentional.

The obsequies were all that ""the boys"" could desire.  Such a marvel of funeral pomp had never
been seen in Virginia.  The plumed hearse, the dirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts
of business, the flags drooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret
societies, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines, carriages of officials,
and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks,
roofs and windows; and for years afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display
in Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw's funeral.

Scotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent place at the funeral, and
when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead man's soul ascended,
he responded, in a low voice, but with feelings:

""AMEN.  No Irish need apply.""

As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was probably nothing more than
a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it
was ""his word.""

Scotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion
that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs; and it transpired that the man who had it
in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber
whereof to construct a Christian.  The making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish
his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to
the other.

THE PEASANT PROPRIETARY OF ROUMANIA.

The precise terms and circumstances under which the peasant proprietary was formed in Roumania,
as communicated to us by Prince Jon Ghika, are as follows:--

Before the 'Convention of Balta Liman' between Russia and Turkey, there were three classes
of peasantry:

1. Those who possessed four beasts of burden and one cow. 2.   ""    ""      ""     two    "" 
""      ""       "" 3.   ""    ""      ""     one cow only.

By the Convention above named each class was to receive the following land, to be paid for
in certain cases by twenty-two days' labour, 1/10th of the harvest and 1/5th of the hay.

CLASS 1.--(11 pogones, or 5-1/2 hectares), or about 14 acres, namely:

                   3 pogones = about 3-8/10 acres arable.
                   3    ""    =   ""   3-8/10   ""   hay.
                   5    ""    =   ""   6-4/10   ""   pasturage.

CLASS 2.--7-8/10 pogones, or about 10 acres, viz.:
                   3-8/10 acres arable.
                   3-8/10   ""   pasturage.
                   2-8/10   ""   hay; and

CLASS 3.--4-1/2 pogones, or about 5-1/2 acres, viz.:
                   3-8/10 acres arable.
                   1-2/10   ""   hay.
                   6/10     ""   pasturage.

In 1864 these holdings, varying, therefore, from 5 to 14 acres, were converted into freeholds
at about 2l. per acre, repayable (as stated in the text) in fifteen years, with 10 per cent.
interest.

Mr. White, our Minister at Bucarest, has favoured us with the following information on the
same subject:--

The peasant heads of families who were endowed with land (in 1864) received freeholds:

In Wallachia     279,684, averaging 9.1 English acres.

INTRODUCTORY TO ""THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER""

And when, and where, do you think we find the children next?  No longer in the winter-time,
but in the merry month of May.  No longer in Tauglewood play-room, or at Tanglewood fireside,
but more than half-way up a monstrous hill, or a mountain, as perhaps it would be better pleased
to have us call it.  They had set out from home with the mighty purpose of climbing this high
hill, even to the very tiptop of its bald head.  To be sure, it was not quite so high as  Chimborazo,
or Mont Blanc, and was even a good deal lower than old Graylock.  But, at any rate, it was
higher than a thousand ant-hillocks, or a million of mole hills; and, when measured by the
short strides of little children, might be reckoned a very respectable mountain.

And was Cousin Eustace with the party?  Of that you may be certain; else how could the book
go on a step further?  He was now in the middle of the spring vacation, and looked pretty much
as we saw him four or five months ago, except that, if you gazed quite closely at his upper
lip, you could discern the funniest little bit of a mustache upon it. Setting aside this mark
of mature manhood, you might have considered Cousin Eustace just as much a boy as when you
first became acquainted with him.  He was as merry, as playful, as good-humored, as light of
foot and of spirits, and equally a favorite with the little folks, as he had always been. 
This expedition up the mountain was entirely of his contrivance.  All the way up the steep
ascent, he had encouraged the elder children with his cheerful voice; and when Dandelion, Cowslip,
and Squash-blossom grew weary, he had lugged them along, alternately, on his back.  In this
manner, they had passed through the orc",False,none
